## Climate Change and India:  
Current global strategies for climate change are flawed and not universally applicable.

The Western approach does not seek to address the root of the problem, i.e. overconsumption, but rather chooses to substitute the means to achieve overconsumption.

A one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and developing countries need to be free to choose their own pathways.

India’s ethos emphasises a harmonious relationship with nature, in contrast to the culture of overconsumption in other parts of the developed world.

Shifting towards ‘traditional multi-generational households’ could pave the way towards sustainable housing.

“Mission LiFE” focuses on human-nature harmony, promoting mindful consumption rather than the overconsumption that lies at the root of the global climate change problem.
