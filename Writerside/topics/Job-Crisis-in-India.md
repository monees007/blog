## India's Labour Sector Problems

According to Economic Survey 2022–23

--- | ---
Total Labour Force | 56 crore
Agriculture | 45 %
Manufacturing | 11.4%
Services | 28.9%
Constructions | 13.7%

While Agriculture GVA is stagnant, the problem is appearant that Agriculture is
having Disguised Unemployment.

To enable movement of labour from the agriculture sector into manufacturing, i.e., enabling them the capacity to
produce.
We need to have a good **Entrepreneurial Ecosystem** and **Viable Labour Sector Reforms**.

### Archaic Labour Law

1. Industrial Dispute Act, 1947
2. Factories Act, 1948
3. Contractual Labour (Abolition and Regulation) Act, 1970

These laws disguisly impose Liscence Raj, that limit growth in many ways.

Labour comes under **concurrent list**.
Various States and central Laws are applicable.
Thus, there is complexity with compliance of these laws.

Less approach to Labour court.

Contractual Labourers, without proper Enforcement of the contracts.

> Temporary Employment
> - Unorganised Sector Employment
> - Lack of Social Security

### Low-Wage Economy

1. Poor Vocational Training/ Skill Development
2. Minimum Wage should be raised.
3. While having good GDP growth, it is not corresponding to Wage Growth, because the growth is coming from Capital
   Intensive, not Labour Intensive.

> **India Employment Report**
>
>Unemployment among educated youth is more than unemployment among the uneducated youth.

### Youth Seeking Government Job

1. Permanancy
2. Social Security
3. Better than a low-wage bluecoller job.

### Major Labour Force is having Low Productivity and working in Low Productive Areas

- Agriculture, Animal Husbandary, Fisheries
- Having disguised unemployment

### Minimal Safety Protocol Missing in many Hazardous Sectors

1. Life Threatening Diseases, like posioning, Carcinogen Intraction
2. Manual Scavenging
    - Intestinal Problems, Skin Diseases, Pathogens
    - Supreme Court in Kamladhar Gupta Case, Manual Scavenging is a complete violation of Article 14, 17, 21, 47 of the
      Indian Constitution
    - **Alanga, Gujrat** Ship Breaking Dock
        - Labour Force comes in contact with Various Hazardous Chemicals.

### Child Labourers

1. Low Wages
2. Economic Hardship of Family
3. Kailash Satyarthi's , **Bachpan Bachao Mission**

- Modern Day Slavery
- _Walk-Free Foundation's_ **Global Slavery Index** also pointed this.
- **Gurupad Swamy Community**, pointed rehabilitaion after rescuing is inddispensable.

### Other Problems

1. Multiplicity of Definition of Labour, Wages, Establishments in different Sectors.
2. Lack of Formalisation
3. Retrenchment and Hiring Policy.
4. Dwarfism of Companies
5. Lack of Institutional Governance
    - No Statuary or Constitutional Body
6. Lack of Lok Adalat and LAbour Court

> # Second Labour Law Commision
> Established by the Government of India on October 15, 1999 to bring about labour reforms.
>
> The commission was led by Ravindra Varma, a former Union Minister for Labour and a Gandhian.
>
> The commission submitted its report to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on June 29, 2002.
>
> # Three-tier system
> The commission recommended a three-tier system of Lok Adalats, Labour Courts, and the Labour Relations Commission.
> The Lok Adalats and Labour Courts would handle individual grievances and complaints.
> # Wages boards
>The commission recommended setting up wages boards to determine wage rates for workers in any industry.
> # Social security
> The commission believed that labour law legislation wasn’t enough to address employee social security issues.
>
> They recommended creating a National Policy on Social Security and a nationwide plan to achieve the goals outlined in
> the Indian Constitution.
> # Hire and fire
> The commission suggested amending Chapter VA of the Act to provide 60 days' notice for both retrenchment and closure.
>
> They also recommended making it possible to close down establishments with 300 or more workers and repealing Chapter
> VB.
>
> This would have essentially left almost 60% of the workforce to a "hire and fire" regime based on changing market
> demands.

**Worker Population Ratio (WPR) Increase**: The WPR for persons aged 15 years and above increased to 56.0% in 2022–23,
showing a consistent rise from previous years.

**Unemployment Rate Decline**: The overall unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above decreased to 3.2%,
continuing a downward trend from 4.1% in 2021–22.

**Youth Unemployment**: The unemployment rate for the youth (aged 15–29 years old) has also declined,
dropping from 12.4% in 2021–22 to 10.0% in 2022–23.

**Urban-Rural Disparity**: The report highlights the persistent disparity between urban and rural areas,
with rural areas showing a higher WPR compared to urban areas.

**Gender Disparity**: While the WPR for women increased, it still remains significantly lower than that for men,
indicating ongoing gender disparities in the workforce.

**Sectoral Employment Shifts**: The share of employment in agriculture continues to decline,
with more people moving into construction, manufacturing, and services sectors.

**Formal vs. Informal Employment**: The report notes a gradual increase in formal employment, though informal employment
still constitutes a large portion of the workforce.

**Impact of Education**: Higher educational attainment is associated with lower unemployment rates, emphasising the
importance of education in employability.

**Self-Employment**: A significant proportion of the employed population remains in self-employment, particularly in
rural areas.

**Policy Implications**:
The findings suggest a need for targeted policies to further reduce unemployment, especially among the youth and women,
and to support the transition from informal to formal employment.

### Problems of Emploment Data

Doesn’t calculate dropouts of EPFO

## JobLess Growth in India

1. The problem of Underemployment is much more than the problem of Unemployment.

   > **Underemployment**
   >
   > Though working, but still open for a part-time job.
   >
   > Wages aren’t proportional to skill aquired.
2. Urban Unemployment is much more than Rural Unemployment.
3. Low Productivity
4. Informal Sector
5. Low Skilled Workers
6. Extreme Competition from Eastern Asian Countries, i.e. China, Vietnam, Combodia.
7. Poor Enforcement of Contract.
8. **Vulnerability of Migrant Workers/Labourers**
   High pressure on Municipalities, Railway


## Skill Development Issues

Skill development in India faces several challenges that hinder the country's ability to fully capitalise on its
demographic dividend and meet the demands of a rapidly evolving global economy.
Some of the key issues include:

### 1. **Mismatch Between Education and Industry Needs**

- **Curriculum Irrelevance**: Many educational institutions offer outdated curricula that don't align with current
  industry needs.
  This creates a gap between the skills that graduates possess and what employers are looking for.
- **Lack of Practical Training**: The focus in education often remains on theoretical knowledge, with insufficient
  emphasis on hands-on, practical skills that are directly applicable in the workplace.

### 2. **Quality of Training**

- **Insufficient Infrastructure**: Many training institutions, especially in rural areas, lack the necessary
  infrastructure, including modern equipment and qualified trainers.
- **Trainer Quality**: There is a shortage of well-trained instructors who can deliver high-quality training.
  Many
  trainers themselves may not be up to date with the latest industry trends.

### 3. **Access and Inclusivity**

- **Urban-Rural Divide**: Skill development opportunities are often concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural
  populations with limited access to quality training programs.
- **Gender Disparity**: Women often face cultural and societal barriers that limit their participation in skill
  development programs, leading to lower employment rates for women in skilled professions.

### 4. **Awareness and Perception**

- **Low Awareness**: Many people, especially in rural areas, are unaware of the various skill development programs
  available to them.
  This limits enrollment in such programs.
- **Stigma Around Vocational Training**: There is often a societal preference for traditional academic education over
  vocational training, which is seen as less prestigious.

### 5. **Funding and Policy Implementation**

- **Insufficient Funding**: Although the government has launched several initiatives for skill development, the funds
  allocated are often insufficient to meet the large-scale demand.
- **Policy Gaps**: While there are many policies in place, their implementation is often inconsistent, leading to
  inefficiencies and underutilisation of resources.

### 6. **Technological Disruption**

- **Rapid Technological Changes**: The pace of technological change is creating new job roles and making some skills
  obsolete.
  Training programs often struggle to keep up with these changes.
- **Digital Divide**: Limited access to technology and the internet in certain areas further exacerbates the challenge
  of updating skills relevant to new-age jobs.

### 7. **Placement and Employment Issues**

- **Low Placement Rates**: Even after completing skill development programs, many trainees find it difficult to secure
  jobs due to the mismatch between their training and the actual job market demands.
- **Underemployment**: Many skilled workers are underemployed, meaning they’re working in jobs that don’t fully
  use their skills or offer adequate compensation.

### 8. **Lack of Soft Skills**

- **Communication and Interpersonal Skills**: Many graduates lack soft skills like communication, teamwork, and
  problem-solving, which are increasingly important in the modern workplace.
- **Workplace Readiness**: Beyond technical skills, there is a gap in preparing individuals for the work environment,
  including understanding workplace culture and expectations.

### 9. **Regional Disparities**

- **Variation Across States**: The quality and availability of skill development programs vary significantly from state
  to state, leading to regional disparities in skilled workforce availability.

### 10. **Private Sector Engagement**

- **Limited Private Sector Involvement**: The private sector's involvement in skill development is often limited,
  despite being a key beneficiary of a skilled workforce.
  There is a need for stronger collaboration between the
  government, educational institutions, and industry.

## Employment Incentive Schemes 2024–25

The 2024 Union Budget introduced several key employment incentive schemes aimed at boosting job creation, particularly
for first-time employees and employers.
Here are the main highlights:

**Wage Support for Freshers**: A direct benefit transfer scheme that provides one month's wage (up to ₹15,000) for
freshers entering the formal workforce.
This incentive is disbursed in three installments, supporting around 2.1 crore
youth.

**Job Creation in Manufacturing**: This scheme incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector by covering the
Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) contributions for both employers and employees during the first four years of employment
for new hires.

**Support for Employers**: Employers receive a reimbursement of up to ₹3,000 per month for each new employee's EPF
contribution, benefiting up to 30 lakh youth.
This scheme is expected to drive significant employment growth across
various sectors.

**Skill Development Initiatives**: The budget also announced a centrally sponsored scheme to skill 20 lakh youth over
the next five years, with a significant investment in upgrading Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs).

**Internship Program**:
A large-scale internship program offering internships in 500 top companies to one crore youth over
five years, with monthly allowances and training costs covered by participating companies.

These schemes reflect a comprehensive approach to enhancing employability and job creation in India, with a focus on
linking incentives directly to employment generation
