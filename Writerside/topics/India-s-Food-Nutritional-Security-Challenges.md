2. improving access to institutional credit
3. enabling crop diversification
4. promoting digitisation, and mechanisation
5. encouraging adoption of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming.
6. focusing on productivity enhancement
7. Fixing MSPs as one and half times (1.5x) all-India weighted average cost of production, 2018-19
8. Income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, giving the farmer a direct financial benefit of ₹6000/- per year.

**Digi-Claim-Payment Module** A new module has been launched to integrate
the National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP) with public financial management
system (PFMS) end-to-end.  Now, the government will have visibility of the quantum of
eligible claims, claims paid by the Insurance Company and actual claims transferred to
beneficiary farmers.
**Yield Estimation Based on Technology (YES-Tech)** is a technology-based yield
estimation mechanism developed after two years of rigorous testing and a pilot that
runs across 100 country districts. Nine states, namely, Assam, Haryana, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu & Karnataka & Odisha,
are implementing Yes-Tech from the Kharif 2023 season onwards.
**Weather Information Network & Data System (WINDS)** is a pioneering
initiative to set up a network of Automatic Weather Stations & Rain Gauges at Taluk/
Block and Gram Panchayat (GP) levels for use of all farmer and farming-oriented
services. It is proposed that an automatic rain gauge (ARG) would be installed at every
GP and an automatic weather station (AWS) at every block covered under PMFBY.
**Collection of Real-time Observations and Photographs of Crops (CROPIC)**
is an initiative that has been taken up to collect periodic photographs of crops during
their life cycle. These photographs will validate sown and insured crops, assess crop
damage when any localised and widespread calamity or climatic condition affects the
crops, and act as an input for Technology-based yield estimation models


> ## Doubling Farmers Income Report (DFI) 2016
> expert committee chaired by Ashok Dalwai
>
> **Key aspects of the report include:**
>
> **Productivity Growth**: The report emphasizes increasing farm productivity through technological interventions, better seed varieties, efficient use of water, and adoption of climate-resilient farming methods.
>
> **Cost Reduction**: It advocates for reducing the cost of cultivation by promoting efficient use of inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, and water, as well as encouraging the use of organic farming and precision agriculture techniques.
>
> **Value Addition and Diversification**: The report stresses the need for crop diversification and the promotion of allied activities like animal husbandry, horticulture, and fisheries to enhance income opportunities beyond traditional crops.
>
> **Market Reforms**: One of the core strategies is to improve farmers' access to markets, ensuring better price realization through reforms like e-NAM (National Agriculture Market), reducing intermediaries, and enhancing storage and transportation infrastructure.
>
> **Risk Management**: It highlights the importance of robust insurance schemes and financial safety nets to protect farmers from risks like crop failure, price volatility, and natural disasters.
>
> **Institutional Reforms**: The report calls for strengthening farmer organizations, cooperatives, and better governance in agricultural extension services to ensure that farmers have access to updated knowledge and technologies.
