## Requirement of Criminal Justice Reforms in India

1. Being colonial in origin, our CJS was more punitive/retributive rather than reformative.

2. So far, IPC & CRPC has failed to inculcate various Supreme Court judgements which are essential for Criminal Justice Reforms.

   - **_Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, 2014_** FIR should not be registered under Article IPC-498a (Dowry Protection), until and unless a proper preliminary inquiry has been done by Investigating Officer. 
   - **_Prakash Singh v. Union of India, 2006_** (Police Reforms)
   - **_Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, 1997_** (Women safety at Workplace) 
   - **_Shreya Singhal Case_** (Right to Digital Freedom)

3. In India, scope of bail is very limited, like in CrPC 41-A. 
  > Default Bail/Statuary Bail, CrPC-167, If chargesheet has not been submitted on time.
  - **_Satyendra Kumar Antil v. CBI_**, Supreme Court asked the Central Government to do a proper bail reforms in our country.

4. In the past few years, various cases of political prisioners are on increase. In order to rectify it, out legal jurisprudence, should have a well-defined approach toward following provisions of IPC.
   1. IPC 124A: **Sedition** 
      - _**Kedarnath Singh Case**:_ Until and unless there is a clear-cut proof that the person's statement is disturbing the tranquillity, merely saying something doesn't amount to sedition.
      - _**Thwah Faisal Case**:_ Merely reading certain document does not amount to sedition.
      - IPC 124A has been upheld in Kedarnath Singh case, and at the same time it is very much required to maintain the soverignity and integrity of socity.
