# Listener-AI

## GPTs
Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) are engines that produce an output that is generated on the basis of data, that the model has been trained on, to satisfy the prompt. 
It learns on reward-punishment model. If the users like the response, it tries to follow the same path in the huge neural network. 

## Issue with this model

While the current model is limited to process only texts and images, it is limited to work with prompts only. There are three ways interaction with model is going on:
    
- On Hot-word detection
- Continued speech-to-text(STT) conversion and prompting AI for response.

Both these methods are having inherent limitation, treating communication as a set of prompt, with a small context.
This approach is less human, as expressions, breaks, and emphasis are necessary part of communication, which get destroyed in STTs.
 



## What is Listener-AI
Listener-AI is an interaction model for AI, which process voice directly rather than converting it to text. Here accuracy of output is not on focus. Understanding the user is. It is supposed to be processing more inputs from other sensors of android device. 
It can listen to group of people discussing on a topic and identify each speaker maintain context and add on a missed point in discussion.
