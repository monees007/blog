## State of the Indian Economy

### High Economic Growth and Low Inflation

India is having a long-term economic stability due to the monetary stability created by RBI.
India's economy carried forward the momentum it built in FY23 into FY24 despite a gamut
of global and external challenges.

The focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability ensured
that these challenges had minimal impact on India’s economy.
As a result, India’s real GDP grew
by 8.2 percent in FY24, posting growth of over 7 percent for a third consecutive year, driven by
stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand.

On the supply side,
gross value-added (GVA) in 2011–12 prices grew by 7.2 percent in FY24, with growth remaining
broad-based.

Net taxes at constant (2011–12) prices grew by 19.1 percent in FY24, aided by
reasonably strong tax growth, both at the center and state levels and rationalization of subsidy
expenditure.
This led to the difference between GDP and GVA growth in FY24.
